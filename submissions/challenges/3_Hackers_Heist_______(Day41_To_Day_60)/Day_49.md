## **Day 49: The Data Logger – Sensor Data Analysis** 📊🌐

### **📜 Kahani / Story**  
After simulating sensor data on Day 48, the next step in our mission is to record and analyze these readings. In the multiverse’s control center, data loggers are used to monitor and ensure that the systems work flawlessly.  
   
Echo explains,  
*"Jab sensors continuously data bhejte hain, toh unhe record karke analyze karna bahut zaroori hota hai. Tumhara challenge hai ek data logger create karna – jisme tum sensor readings ko store karke, unka average, minimum, aur maximum nikaloge. Yeh concept real-world applications mein widely use hota hai, from industrial monitoring to consumer electronics."*  

Nariyal Bhai adds,  
*"Bilkul waise hi jaise hum daily lab measurements record karte hain, tumhe bhi yeh numbers capture karne hain. Simple statistics se pata chalega ki system kitna stable hai."*  

Mayur, with a calm tone, remarks,  
*"Data ka analysis sirf ek code ka challenge nahi, balki ek practical tool hai in ensuring system reliability. Tumhara solution ye dikhayega ki tum kitni efficiency se real-world data ko process kar sakte ho."*

Iss tarah, tumhari coding journey real-world applications aur ECE concepts ke beech ka bridge ban jati hai, jahan tum sensor data ko aggregate karke insights nikalte ho.

### **🎯 Challenge: Sensor Data Logger & Analyzer**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes a series of sensor readings as input** (space-separated integers or floats).  
2. **Stores the readings in an array or list.**  
3. **Calculates and prints:**
   - **Average (mean) value**
   - **Minimum value**
   - **Maximum value**

*Note:*  
- Ensure that your program handles any number of inputs.
- The calculation should be accurate even if the readings are floats.

### **🔍 Example Inputs/Outputs**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter sensor readings: 24 27 22 25 26
```  
**Output:**  
```
Average: 24.8
Minimum: 22
Maximum: 27
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter sensor readings: 18.5 20.3 19.8 21.0 20.0
```  
**Output:**  
```
Average: 19.92
Minimum: 18.5
Maximum: 21.0
```

#### **Example 3**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter sensor readings: 30 28 32 31 29 33
```  
**Output:**  
```
Average: 30.5
Minimum: 28
Maximum: 33
```

### **💡 Hints**  
- **Input Handling:**  
  - Split the input string to get individual sensor readings and convert them to numbers (integers or floats).  
- **Calculations:**  
  - Use loops or built-in functions to compute the sum, minimum, and maximum values.  
  - Divide the total sum by the count of readings to find the average.
- **Real-World Connection:**  
  - Think of this process as similar to how industrial data loggers monitor equipment status and trigger alerts if values deviate from the norm.

---

### **📝 Tumhara Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day49_data_logger.[ext]` (for example, `day49_data_logger.py`).

### **🌟 Motivational Quote**  
*"Every data point tells a story. Analyze wisely, for in the numbers lies the path to clarity and success."* 🚀
