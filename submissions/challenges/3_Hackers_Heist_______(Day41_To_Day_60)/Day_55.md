## **Day 55: The Signal Booster – Maximum Signal Strength!** 📈⚡

### **📜 Kahani / Story**  
After reassembling the fragmented packets, a continuous stream of signal data flows through the multiverse. However, due to interference and noise, not every part of the signal is strong.  
   
Echo explains,  
*"Yaar, in the received signals, kuch segments bahut powerful hain – they boost our overall strength. Tumhara challenge hai un segments ko dhoondhna jo maximum strength provide karte hain. Yeh bilkul waise hi hai jaise real-world systems mein, hum signal boosters aur amplifiers use karte hain to enhance data quality."*  

Nariyal Bhai adds,  
*"Bilkul, jaise hum circuits mein best-performing segments ko filter karte hain, tumhe yahan continuous data stream mein se maximum contiguous segment find karna hai. Yeh ek classic problem hai – the maximum subarray problem – jo DSA mein bahut famous hai."*  

Mayur concludes,  
*"Tumhara solution signal ke sabse strong part ko highlight karega, ensuring that our communication remains robust against interference. Let your code boost the signal to its maximum potential!"*

Iss tarah, tumhari coding journey ne DSA ke concepts ko real-world signal processing se link kar diya hai.

### **🎯 Challenge: Maximum Subarray Problem (Kadane’s Algorithm)**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes an array of integers as input** representing signal strength values over time.  
2. **Finds the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum**, which represents the strongest segment of the signal.  
3. **Prints the maximum sum along with the subarray** (optional).

*Note:*  
- This problem is commonly solved using Kadane’s algorithm.  
- The array may contain both positive and negative values.

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter signal strengths (space-separated): -2 1 -3 4 -1 2 1 -5 4
```  
**Output:**  
```
Maximum Signal Strength: 6
Strongest Segment: 4 -1 2 1
```  
*(Explanation: The subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] has the maximum sum 6.)*

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter signal strengths: 1 2 3 -2 5
```  
**Output:**  
```
Maximum Signal Strength: 9
Strongest Segment: 1 2 3 -2 5
```  
*(Explanation: The entire array gives the maximum sum 9.)*

#### **Example 3**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter signal strengths: -1 -2 -3 -4
```  
**Output:**  
```
Maximum Signal Strength: -1
Strongest Segment: -1
```  
*(Explanation: When all numbers are negative, the maximum subarray is the least negative number.)*

### **💡 Hints**  
- **Kadane’s Algorithm:**  
  - Initialize two variables: `max_current` and `max_global` with the first element of the array.  
  - Iterate through the array, updating `max_current` as the maximum of the current element and `max_current + current element`.  
  - Update `max_global` if `max_current` exceeds it.
- **Real-World Connection:**  
  - Think of this as finding the optimal signal segment in a noisy transmission, much like amplifiers boost the best parts of a signal for clarity.

### **📝 Tumhara Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day55_signal_booster.[ext]` (for example, `day55_signal_booster.py`).

### **🌟 Motivational Quote**  
*"Every strong signal has its peak moment – find that peak and let it guide you to clarity. Boost your potential and shine on!"* 🚀
