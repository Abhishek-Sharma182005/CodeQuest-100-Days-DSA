## **Day 44: The Frequency Analyzer – Spectrum Sifting for Clear Signals** 📶🔎

### **📜 Kahani / Story**  
Tum ab multiverse ke ek high-tech communications hub mein ho, jahan The Glitch ke corrupt signals ki wajah se data transmission disturb ho rahi hai.  
Professor Echo ne tumhe ek practical assignment diya hai jo real-world ECE systems se directly linked hai.  
  
Echo explains,  
*"Jab hum wireless ya digital signals transmit karte hain, toh unme alag-alag frequencies hoti hain. Kabhi-kabhi, noise se kuch frequencies disturb ho jati hain. Tumhara challenge hai in frequencies ko analyze karke dekhna ki kaunsi frequency sabse zyada baar aati hai – jise hum mode kehte hain. Yeh process real-world signal processing mein bahut important hai, jisse hum interference ko identify karte hain."*

Nariyal Bhai adds,  
*"Socho, yeh bilkul waise hi hai jaise hum spectrum analyzers se data ko monitor karte hain. Tumhara code bhi har frequency ko count karega aur sabse common frequency batayega, taaki system ko optimize kiya ja sake."*

Mayur, with his usual dramatic flair, chimes in,  
*"Yeh frequency analysis na sirf coding ka challenge hai, balki ek practical tool hai in ensuring reliable communication. Har signal ko sahi tareeke se interpret karna, error-free transmission ka raasta hai!"*

Iss tarah, tumhari coding journey real-world ECE applications se connect hoti hai, jahan signal integrity aur spectral analysis critical role play karte hain.

### **🎯 Challenge: Frequency Analyzer**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes a list of integer frequencies as input** (each frequency representing a component of the transmitted signal).  
2. **Determines the most common frequency (the mode)** and counts its occurrences.  
3. **Prints the most common frequency along with its count.**

*Note:*  
- If multiple frequencies occur with the same maximum count, you may print any one or all of them.

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter frequencies (space-separated): 100 150 100 200 150 100
```  
**Output:**  
```
Most common frequency: 100 (occurs 3 times)
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter frequencies (space-separated): 90 90 110 110 130 90 110
```  
**Output:**  
```
Most common frequency: 90 (occurs 3 times)
```

#### **Example 3**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter frequencies (space-separated): 50 60 70 80
```  
**Output:**  
```
Each frequency occurs only once.
```

### **💡 Hints**  
- **Frequency Counting:**  
  - Use a dictionary or hash map to count occurrences of each frequency.  
- **Finding the Mode:**  
  - Iterate through your counts to identify the frequency with the highest occurrence.  
- **Real-World Connection:**  
  - This is similar to how spectrum analyzers identify dominant frequencies in signals to ensure clear data transmission.

---

### **📝 Tumhara Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day44_frequency_analyzer.[ext]` (e.g., `day44_frequency_analyzer.py`).

### **🌟 Motivational Quote**  
*"Har signal ki apni story hoti hai – jab tum usse sahi se analyze karte ho, tabhi system ka asli raaz pata chalta hai. Keep decoding the spectrum of success!"* 🚀
