## **Day 53: The Intrusion Detector – Binary Search for Anomaly** 🔍🚨

### **📜 Kahani / Story**  
In the multiverse's central control hub, the system logs server response times to ensure smooth operation. Normally, these response times follow a steady, predictable pattern. But suddenly, The Glitch has tampered with the data—one response time is out of place, an anomaly that could signal a security breach.

Echo warns,  
*"Our logs should show a steady increase, but there's a glitch in the data! Use your binary search skills to quickly locate the anomalous response time. This technique is critical not only in algorithms but also in real-world intrusion detection systems."*

Nariyal Bhai adds,  
*"Bilkul, jaise hum lab measurements mein outliers dekhte hain, tumhara kaam hai woh abnormal value dhoondhna. Efficiency is key—binary search se ye anomaly easily pakdi ja sakti hai!"*

Mayur, with a composed tone, concludes,  
*"Let your code be the detective that scans through sorted logs and identifies the miscreant value. In a real-world scenario, this could be the first step in thwarting a network intrusion."*

Iss tarah, tumhari coding journey seamlessly connects DSA concepts with real-world applications in system monitoring and security.

### **🎯 Challenge: Intrusion Detector using Binary Search**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes a sorted array of integers as input** representing server response times, which ideally follow a constant incremental pattern (e.g., each element increases by a fixed difference).  
2. **Finds and prints the anomalous response time**—the one element that breaks the pattern (i.e., the expected constant difference is not maintained).  

*Hint:*  
- Use binary search to efficiently narrow down the region where the anomaly occurs.

### **🔍 Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter response times (space-separated): 100 110 120 140 150
```  
**Explanation:**  
- Expected pattern: difference of 10.  
- Anomaly: 140 (should be 130).  
**Output:**  
```
Anomalous response time detected: 140
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter response times (space-separated): 200 210 220 230 250 260
```  
**Explanation:**  
- Expected pattern: difference of 10.  
- Anomaly: 250 (should be 240).  
**Output:**  
```
Anomalous response time detected: 250
```

#### **Example 3**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter response times (space-separated): 50 60 70 90 100
```  
**Explanation:**  
- Expected pattern: difference of 10.  
- Anomaly: 90 (should be 80).  
**Output:**  
```
Anomalous response time detected: 90
```

### **💡 Hints**  
- **Binary Search:**  
  - Determine the expected difference (e.g., by comparing the first two elements).  
  - Use binary search to compare the actual value with the expected value at the midpoint.  
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - If no anomaly is found, print a message stating that the data is normal.  
- **Real-World Connection:**  
  - This mirrors how real systems use quick search algorithms to detect abnormal patterns in log data, which is essential for early intrusion detection.

### **📝 Tumhara Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day53_intrusion_detector.[ext]` (e.g., `day53_intrusion_detector.py`).

### **🌟 Motivational Quote**  
*"Efficient detection is the first line of defense. Let your code be the vigilant guard that secures the system against anomalies!"* 🚀

Your intrusion detector bridges the gap between algorithmic efficiency and real-world security monitoring. Tumhara code will serve as a prototype for detecting potential intrusions and maintaining the integrity of system logs.
