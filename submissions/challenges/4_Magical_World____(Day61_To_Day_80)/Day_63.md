## **Day 63: The Spell Enchanter ‚Äì Infix to Postfix Conversion** ‚ú®üîÑ

### **üìú Kahani / Story**  
In the ancient archives of the enchanted library, you discover a powerful spell written in a traditional, human-readable format (infix notation). However, to unleash its full magical potential, the spell must be restructured into a format that the magical system can process swiftly ‚Äì the mystical postfix notation.  

Echo explains,  
*"In the realm of magic and logic, converting an infix expression (like A+B) to postfix (AB+) is crucial for efficient spell casting. Yeh process, jo stack ka use karke hota hai, is very similar to how real-world systems evaluate complex expressions quickly."*

Nariyal Bhai adds,  
*"Socho, jaise tum electronics mein signal processing karte ho using filters, waise hi yeh conversion system ko speed aur clarity deta hai. It‚Äôs all about reorganizing the components for optimal performance!"*

Mayur concludes,  
*"Let your code be the wand that transforms chaotic infix expressions into orderly, enchanting postfix sequences. This skill is fundamental not only in magic but also in the world of compilers and calculators."*

Iss tarah, tumhari coding journey DSA ke practical stack concepts ko real-world expression evaluation se jodti hai.

### **üéØ Challenge: Infix to Postfix Converter**  
Write a program that:  
1. **Takes an infix expression as input.**  
   - The expression can include operands (like alphabets or digits) and operators (+, -, *, /, ^) along with parentheses.
2. **Converts the infix expression into its equivalent postfix expression** using a stack-based approach.
3. **Prints the resulting postfix expression.**

*Note:*  
- Follow the standard operator precedence:  
  - '^' (exponentiation) has the highest precedence (right-associative),  
  - '*' and '/' come next,  
  - '+' and '-' have the lowest precedence.
- Assume that the input expression is valid.

### **üîç Example Input/Output**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter infix expression: A+B*C
```  
**Output:**  
```
Postfix Expression: ABC*+
```

#### **Example 2**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter infix expression: (A+B)*C-D
```  
**Output:**  
```
Postfix Expression: AB+C*D-
```

#### **Example 3**  
**Input:**  
```
Enter infix expression: A+(B*C-(D/E^F)*G)*H
```  
**Output:**  
```
Postfix Expression: ABC*DEF^/G*-H*+
```

### **üí° Hints**  
- **Stack Usage:**  
  - Use a stack to temporarily hold operators and parentheses.
- **Algorithm Steps:**  
  - Iterate through each character in the expression.  
  - If the character is an operand, add it directly to the output.  
  - If the character is an operator, pop from the stack to the output until the top of the stack has an operator with lower precedence, then push the current operator.  
  - Handle opening and closing parentheses appropriately.
- **Real-World Connection:**  
  - This conversion technique is widely used in compilers and calculators for efficient expression evaluation, much like optimizing circuits for faster signal processing.

### **üìù Tumhara Task**  
- Write your solution in **any programming language** (Python, C++, Java, etc.).  
- Save your file as `day63_spell_enchanter.[ext]` (for example, `day63_spell_enchanter.py`).

### **üåü Motivational Quote**  
*"Transform chaos into order, and let your logic illuminate the path. With every conversion, your magic becomes more precise!"* üöÄ
